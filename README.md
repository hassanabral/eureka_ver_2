- [A blog post about my process in developing this app](https://dev.to/hassanabral/building-a-crud-app-with-cloud-firestore-4392).

Here is the **tech stack** I used for this project:

- JavaScript
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) 
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Redux form](https://redux-form.com/8.3.0/)
- **NPM packages**: moment, react-html-parser, react-infinite-scroller, react-redux-toaster, ck-editor).

### How to run it locally?
- ``` npm install ```
- ``` npm run start ```

#### **keys_dev.js** needs to be created (inside src/app/config directory):
```
module.exports = {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  databaseURL: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  appId: ""
}
```
